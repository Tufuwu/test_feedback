.. title:: symspellpy: a SymSpell Python port

symspellpy
==========

symspellpy is a Python port of SymSpell_ v6.5, a Symmetric Delete
spelling correction algorithm which provides much higher speed and lower
memory consumption.

.. _SymSpell: https://github.com/wolfgarbe/SymSpell

Unit tests from the original project are implemented to ensure the accuracy
of the port. Please note that the port has tried to replicate the code
structure of the original project and has not been optimized for speed.
