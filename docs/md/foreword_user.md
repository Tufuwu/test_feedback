# How to read this manual

The different sections of this manual are presented in the theoretical order of operations: you start by preparing your collection of programs, these programs are labeled, these labels are translated into taxa, the results are stored in a database; finally, you filter this database through a command pipeline to extract recommendations.

In practice, your input is only required for the last stage. That's why we suggest you observe the following order:

1. Start by reading the [pipeline tutorial](#pipeline-tutorial): it explains, in a user-friendly style, what you can expect from Paroxython and how you may integrate it into your teaching.
2. Once you are familiar with this aspect, see if you can improve or enrich the results through some [preparation of the programs in your collection](#preparing-your-program-collection).
3. If needed, adapt the default [taxonomy](#taxonomy) to your own vision of how to teach programming.
4. Harness the [full power of the pipeline](#pipeline-documentation) with its most advanced commands.

Of course, you can consult at any time the [glossary](#glossary) of terms specific to Paroxython.
