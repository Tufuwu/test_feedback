## Is BundleWrap the right tool for you?

We think you will enjoy BundleWrap a lot if you:

-   know some Python
-   like to write your configuration from scratch and control every bit
    of it
-   have lots of unique nodes
-   are trying to get a lot of existing systems under management
-   are NOT trying to handle a massive amount of nodes (let’s say more
    than 1000)
-   like to start small
-   don’t want yet more stuff to run on your nodes (or mess with
    appliances as little as possible)
-   prefer a simple tool to a fancy one
-   want as much as possible in git/hg/bzr
-   have strongly segmented internal networks

You might be better served with a different config management system if
you:

-   are already using a config management system and don’t have any
    major issues
-   hate Python and/or JSON
-   like to use community-maintained configuration templates
-   need unattended bootstrapping of nodes
-   don’t trust your coworkers
