Update in 0.3.6
---------------

  - Fixed code block detection when there are code block(s) selected.
  - Better error handlings around communicating via Jupyter APIs (related to #19).

Now we plan to rename and refactor the commands as argued in #4 (working branch is #14).
If you have any openion about it, feel free to express it in the issue.
