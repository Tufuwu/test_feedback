Update in 0.3.4
---------------

  - Add request parameter on creating WebSocket connection to avoid "No session ID specified" warning dumped to the server log (#9).
  - Show progress bar while the kernel is busy(#12).
  - Disable "Hermes: Execute Block" command if the kernel is dead (#13).

Now we plan to rename and refactor the commands as argued in #4 (working branch is #14).
If you have any openion about it, feel free to express it in the issue.
