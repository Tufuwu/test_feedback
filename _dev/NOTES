Implementation notes
--------------------

string vs. bytes handling, Python 2 & Python 3
==============================================

To enable sane code with minimal Python 2 & 3 deviations, all files are read
in binary mode ('rb') before being passed to ContentMatcher.

On the other hand, since the colorama library (especially on Windows) is 
sensitive to the type of output, all output emitted by DefaultOutputFormatter
is done as a string (unicode on Python 3).

Bad symbolic link
=================

pss should ignore bad symbolic links instead of failing on them. Initially I
included a bad symlink into the test dirs, but this caused problems with
setup.py sdist, so the test was removed.
